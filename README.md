# Mapping_Earthquakes
 An Interactive map of earthquakes
## Purpose
The purpose of this assingment was to learn and build and html page with a layout of eartquakes around the wolrd using javascript and html. We were able to pull the date through LeafLet and pull data with our matchbox API key. With This assignment, we were able to build three layouts of the map with the tectonice plates on the earth. With the three layout, we were able to view the spots of magnititude and how severe it was more visually. We were also able to get the spots of major earthquakes that has happend around the world. I noticed the strong magnitudes occur when it is close to two tectonic plates.
